# higher-or-lower
Android app for the game higher or lower - developed for study purposes

When the app is started, it chooses a random number between 0 and 20. After, it challenges the 
player to figure which number was mysteriously picked. If the player chooses the wrong number, 
the app gives tips to orient next guesses (higher or lower). Finally, when the player finds out the
hidden randomly picked number, the app congratulates the player and offers the possibility of a new
challenge.
